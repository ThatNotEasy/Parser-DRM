Device File Parser (PlayReady &amp; Widevine)

- This repository contains Python code for parsing PlayReady and Widevine device files. It provides functionality to read, interpret, and display data from `.prd` and `.wvd` binary files, which contain device-specific information such as encryption keys, security levels, client IDs, and more. The parsed data is presented in a human-readable format, with optional fields clearly labeled and binary data converted to base64 for easy handling.

## Features:
- Parse `PlayReady` and `Widevine` device files.
- Supports reading binary files and extracting structured data.
- Converts binary data to readable formats such as base64.
- Provides a clear text output for better understanding of device data.

## Footprints Notes:
- To migrate/upgrade a device, I have prepared a file that has been converted into an .exe format using PyInstaller. Before using it, you are free to extract the binary or use tools like Detect It Easy to verify its contents. I want to emphasize that I do not share anything useless or suspicious here. There is nothing hidden or embedded within the file. If you want the source code, feel free to DM me. Thank you.
