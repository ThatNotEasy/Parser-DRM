It provides functionality to read, interpret, and display data from `.prd` and `.wvd` binary files, which contain device-specific information such as encryption keys, security levels, client IDs, and more. The parsed data is presented in a human-readable format, with optional fields clearly labeled and binary data converted to base64 for easy handling.

## Features:
- Parse `PlayReady` and `Widevine` device files.
- Supports reading binary files and extracting structured data.
- Converts binary data to readable formats such as base64.
- Provides a clear text output for better understanding of device data.
